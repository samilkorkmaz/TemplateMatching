# TemplateMatching
Visual Studio 2015 projet to find template image in source image. Uses [EmguCV](https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv) (OpenCV .Net wrapper) 4.1.1, 64bit dlls.

In this example, you first capture frames (using my [ScreenCapture](https://github.com/samilkorkmaz/ScreenCapture) repo) of [floppy bird](https://github.com/samilkorkmaz/floppybird) game and save them. Set Form1.cs, **sourceFileName** to your saved frames folder and file names. The program tries to find matches of images in Resources folder in the frames you captured and saved.
